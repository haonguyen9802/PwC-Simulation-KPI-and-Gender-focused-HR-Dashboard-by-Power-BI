# PwC Simulation: KPI and Gender-focused HR Dashboard by Power BI
I participated in a Power BI Job Simulation with PwC Switzerland, where I designed and implemented a Power BI dashboard to effectively visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. The project focused on creating dashboards that provide insights into customer demographics, behavioral patterns, and HR metrics, with a dedicated emphasis on gender-related KPIs.

The first dashboard, the Call Center Dashboard, was developed to monitor and analyze essential call center performance metrics, including the number of calls and customer satisfaction levels. Interactive filters enabled users to focus on specific agents, topics, or time periods, providing actionable insights into call center efficiency and customer service quality. This dashboard empowered stakeholders to identify performance trends, evaluate service levels, and make data-driven decisions to improve the overall customer experience.

The second dashboard, the Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard, was designed to analyze patterns and factors contributing to customer churn. It first assesses demographic information, customer account details, and subscribed services. Then, it analyzes data based on different attributes to uncover trends and insights. The dashboard aims to identify high-risk customer segments, understand the underlying reasons for churn, and provide actionable recommendations for improving customer retention strategies. By visualizing key metrics and trends, this dashboard supports stakeholders in making informed decisions to enhance customer loyalty and minimize attrition.

## [The Diversity And Inclusion Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/fd75dfee-9fdf-4d11-98fb-6d5635805bd4/43e4ac4e22cfa4990a7f?experience=power-bi)
The third dashboard, the Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard, was designed to assess employee diversity across various attributes, such as promotions, turnover rates, and performance ratings. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the organization's diversity landscape and identify potential disparities in employee experiences. By visualizing key metrics related to diversity and inclusion, this dashboard enables stakeholders to pinpoint areas for improvement, develop targeted initiatives to enhance workplace equity, and foster an inclusive organizational culture. The insights gained from this dashboard support strategic decision-making to promote diversity and ensure that all employees have equal opportunities for growth and advancement.
